> Sean is the most patient and thoughtful instructor I've ever had. He is willing
> to spend extra time to ensure the participants understand the concepts. He uses
> examples that are relevant to the participants and the R files are very
> detailed and helpful. I've attend similar workshops where the instructor talks
> above the participants and it seems like a chore for them to be there, Sean is
> just the opposite. He is able to break complicated concepts down into tangible
> pieces. I benefited from having the time to work on the problems myself during
> the course, even if I needed a little help to make it all the way to the
> light-bulb moment.

> Sean's knowledge of quantitative methods, data visualization, and R-code
> implementation is extraordinary. At the same time, he is able to work at the
> pace of students in the workshop, and is always meeting the participants where
> they are in their comfort level with stats and R.

> Sean is able to explain complex issues that I have been struggling to
> understand for years. In just a few sentences he makes the concept seem so
> simple. Many light-bulb moments!

> I found Sean to be incredibly knowledgeable about statistical models and their
> application to ecological questions using R. Moreover, Sean is up-to-date with
> the most current, "cutting edge" techniques and tools in the field. Lastly,
> I found Sean to be a friendly, funny, open and approachable instructor
> --- personality traits that are absolutely essential to effectively convey
> information to students in a supportive, non-threatening environment.
