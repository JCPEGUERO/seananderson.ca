I believe that the thoughtful visual display of data and statistical models can
powerfully inform conservation ecology and help us 
understand the ecological risks associated with human activities.
I'm a Ph.D. Candidate and Fulbright Scholar in quantitative ecology at 
[Simon Fraser University][sfu] 
in the Earth to Oceans research group, 
Vancouver, Canada.

My [research](/cv.html#publications) broadly spans the field of quantitative ecology across taxa (e.g. sea cucumbers, reef fish, salmon, moths, grizzly bears, amphibians), ecosystems (marine, freshwater, terrestrial), methods (empirical, theoretical, experimental), spatial scale (regional, national, global) and time periods (modern, historical, paleontological).
In my thesis work, I am interested in how we can use tools from 
financial portfolio management to create stable and productive ecosystems. 

<!--I also [work on topics](/cv.html#publications) ranging from -->
<!--species extinction risk to predator-prey-environment interactions -->
<!--to fisheries stock assessment.-->

I [teach workshops](/cv.html#teaching) on data visualization and manipulation
for scientists. I also develop a number of R packages. With collaborators, I'm
developing packages to run fisheries stock assessment simulations with 
[Stock Synthesis][nefsc] software ([ss3sim]), measure ecological portfolio
effects ([ecofolio]), and simulate salmon metapopulation portfolios
([metafolio]).

I completed an M.Sc. at [Dalhousie University][dal] with [Dr. Heike Lotze] working on
trends, drivers, and ecosystem effects of expanding global invertebrate
fisheries. In particular, we focussed on 
[patterns of serial exploitation in global sea cucumber fisheries][cucdoi]
and our paper was [featured in the journal Science][sciencemag]. 
My thesis won the [Canadian Governor General's Gold Medal][gg] 
as the top-ranked M.Sc. thesis at Dalhousie University in Engineering and
Natural Sciences.

<!--I'm [a bit nuts][colophon] about using the right tool for the job and I love to-->
<!--share my passion for these tools. I'm an avid user of the programming languages-->
<!--R, Markdown, LaTeX, Knitr, and Sweave. I'm also a [Vim] devotee and manage my-->
<!--work in [Git on Github][my github]. -->
<!--I [generate this site with Jekyll](/colophon.html).-->
