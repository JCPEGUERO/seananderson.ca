## Non-academic Figures
![IMDb visualization](/figures/movie-star-thumb.jpg)
A visualization of my Dad's movie collection for Christmas 2010. Each line represents a movie. The length of a line indicates the year it was released. Higher-rated movies are brighter and lines are layered with lighter lines on top. The lines are arranged within genres. Within each genre the location of each line is random, so each run of the code produces a slightly different outcome.

![](/figures/photos-exif-thumb.png)
A visualization of my Dad's photography history. Colour indicates the average time of day the photos were taken at. The height of each line represents the number of photos taken per day. I extracted the event names and photo data from the filestructure and exif file information. Everything (except the signature) is done in R --- even the label arrangement.
