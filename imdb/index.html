  <h1>A Visualization of Your Film Collection</h1>
<p>December 2010</p>
  <p>I combined films from your database with data extracted from the Internet Movie Database and visualized the year of release, genre, and popularity of the films in your collection.</p>
<p>Each film is represented by a line. The length of each line represents the log-transformed number of years before present that the film was released. The angular orientation indicates the genre of the film: (in descending order of frequency) drama, action, other (e.g., short, animation), comedy, romance, or documentary. Within each category the films are randomly arranged. The brightness of the colour indicates the popularity of the film; the colour transitions from black to red to white. This popularity is derived from a combination of the rating and the log transformed number of votes for each film. More popular films are superimposed on less popular films.</p>
