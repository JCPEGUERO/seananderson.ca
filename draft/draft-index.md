I am interested in taking on postdoctoral researchers and may be able to arrange co-supervising of graduate students at Simon Fraser University.
There are funding opportunities for postdoctoral researchers that come up with Fisheries and Oceans Canada in the fall through
[SPERA](http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/rp-pr/spera-psrafe/index-eng.html) (Strategic Program for Ecosystem-Based Research and Advice) and
[ACCASP](http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/rp-pr/accasp-psaccma/index-eng.html) (Aquatic Climate Change Adaptation Services Program).
If you have a topic of interest, get in touch and we may be able to write a joint proposal.

Other great funding oppportunities are through the [Liber Ero](http://liberero.ca/) and the [Smith Fellows](https://conbio.org/mini-sites/smith-fellows) programs.

Specific areas of interest:
- spatiotemporal modelling of fish biomass
- ecological extremes in time or time and space, especially related to fish populations
-


If you have mutual research interests, please get in touch.
