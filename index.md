I believe that the thoughtful visual display of data and statistical models can
powerfully inform conservation ecology and help us 
understand the ecological risks associated with human activities.
I'm a postdoctoral researcher
in the [School of Resource and Environmental Management](http://www.rem.sfu.ca/)
at [Simon Fraser University][sfu], Vancouver, Canada. 
In fall 2015 I will begin a [David H. Smith Conservation Research Fellowship](http://www.conbio.org/mini-sites/smith-fellows) at the University of Washington and Northwest Fisheries Science Center.

My [research](/cv.html#publications) broadly spans the field of quantitative ecology across taxa (e.g. sea cucumbers, reef fish, salmon, moths, grizzly bears, amphibians), ecosystems (marine, freshwater, terrestrial), methods (empirical, theoretical, experimental), spatial scale (regional, national, global) and time periods (modern, historical, paleontological).
In my PhD thesis work, I considered how we can use tools from 
financial portfolio management to create stable and productive ecosystems. 

I [teach workshops](/cv.html#teaching) on data visualization and manipulation
for scientists. I also develop a number of R packages. With collaborators, I'm
developing packages to run fisheries stock assessment simulations with 
[Stock Synthesis][nefsc] software ([ss3sim]), measure ecological portfolio
effects ([ecofolio]), and simulate salmon metapopulation portfolios
([metafolio]).
