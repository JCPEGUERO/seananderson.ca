I teach workshops on statistical modelling and data science
in R including multiday courses on [Generalized Linear Mixed Effects
Models](https://github.com/seananderson/glmm-course) (GLMMs) and [Bayesian data
analysis in R and Stan]( https://github.com/seananderson/bayes-course). Please [get in touch](/contact) if you are interested in hosting one of 
these.

Some testimonials from recent courses:

------------------

> Sean is able to explain complex issues that I have been struggling to
> understand for years. In just a few sentences he makes the concept seem so
> simple. Many light-bulb moments!

------------------

> I found Sean to be incredibly knowledgeable about statistical models and their
> application to ecological questions using R. Moreover, Sean is up-to-date with
> the most current, "cutting edge" techniques and tools in the field. Lastly,
> I found Sean to be a friendly, funny, open and approachable instructor
> --- personality traits that are absolutely essential to effectively convey
> information to students in a supportive, non-threatening environment.

------------------

> Sean is the most patient and thoughtful instructor I've ever had. He is willing
> to spend extra time to ensure the participants understand the concepts. He uses
> examples that are relevant to the participants and the R files are very
> detailed and helpful. I've attend similar workshops where the instructor talks
> above the participants and it seems like a chore for them to be there, Sean is
> just the opposite. He is able to break complicated concepts down into tangible
> pieces. I benefited from having the time to work on the problems myself during
> the course, even if I needed a little help to make it all the way to the
> light-bulb moment.
