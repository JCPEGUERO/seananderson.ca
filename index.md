Hi, I'm Sean. I believe that the thoughtful visual display of  data can powerfully inform conservation ecology. 
I work with biology and fisheries scientists to develop data visualizations that tell compelling stories.

I'm a Ph.D. Candidate and Fulbright Scholar in quantitative ecology at [Simon Fraser University](http://sfu.ca) in the [Earth to Oceans lab](http://earth2ocean.org). In my Ph.D. research I am developing methods to apply financial portfolio theory to ecological systems. I also work on topics ranging from species extinction risk to predator-prey-environment interactions to fisheries stock assessment.

<!--My broader research interests include species' extinction risk,-->
<!--large-scale fisheries' development patterns, and assessing the global-->
<!--status of data-poor fisheries.-->


I teach workshops on data visualization and data manipulation for scientists. You can download the [workshop notes](/cv.html#teaching) for some of these sessions. I also develop a number of R packages. Currently I'm working on packages to run fisheries simulations with Stock Synthesis software ([ss3sim](https://github.com/seananderson/ss3sim)), measure ecological portfolio effects ([ecofolio](https://github.com/seananderson/ecofolio)), simulate salmon metapopulation portfolios (metafolio), and perform meta-analysis that is robust to correlated effect sizes ([robustmeta](https://github.com/seananderson/robustmeta)). 

I completed an M.Sc. at [Dalhousie University](http://dal.ca/) working on trends, drivers, and ecosystem effects of expanding global invertebrate fisheries. In particular, I focussed on [patterns of serial exploitation in global sea cucumber fisheries](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2979.2010.00397.x), which was [featured in the journal Science](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6014/129.1.full). My thesis won the [Canadian Governor General's Gold Medal](http://www.gg.ca/honour.aspx?id=75057&t=1&;ln=Anderson) as the top-ranked M.Sc. thesis at Dalhousie University in Engineering and Natural Sciences.
