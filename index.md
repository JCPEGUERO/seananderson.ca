I'm a postdoctoral researcher
in the [School of Resource and Environmental Management](http://www.rem.sfu.ca/)
at [Simon Fraser University][sfu], Vancouver, Canada. 
In September 2015 I will begin a [David H. Smith Conservation Research Fellowship](http://www.conbio.org/mini-sites/smith-fellows) at the University of Washington and Northwest Fisheries Science Center.
I believe that the thoughtful visual display of data and statistical models can
powerfully inform conservation ecology and help us 
understand the ecological risks associated with human activities.

In my [Ph.D. thesis](https://theses.lib.sfu.ca/thesis/etd8887) at [Simon Fraser
University][sfu], I considered how we can use tools from 
financial portfolio management to create stable and productive ecosystems. 
In my [M.Sc. thesis][] at [Dalhousie University][dal], I examined
patterns of serial exploitation in global invertebrate
fisheries — especially [sea cucumber fisheries][cucdoi]. 
My Ph.D. thesis won the Dean of Graduate Studies Convocation Medal and my M.Sc.
thesis won the [Canadian Governor General’s Academic Gold Medal][gg].

My [research](/cv.html#publications) broadly spans the field of quantitative ecology across taxa (e.g. sea cucumbers, reef fish, salmon, moths, grizzly bears, amphibians), ecosystems (marine, freshwater, terrestrial), methods (empirical, theoretical, experimental), spatial scale (regional, national, global), and time periods (modern, historical, paleontological).

I [teach workshops](/cv.html#teaching) on data visualization and manipulation
for scientists. I also develop a number of R packages. With collaborators, I'm
developing packages to run fisheries stock assessment simulations with 
[Stock Synthesis][nefsc] software ([ss3sim]), measure ecological portfolio
effects ([ecofolio]), and simulate salmon metapopulation portfolios
([metafolio]).
