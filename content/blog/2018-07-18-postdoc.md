I am seeking a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO)
Pacific Biological Station (PBS) to lead
a research project on British Columbia groundfish range shifts in response to
local climate velocities.
Key collaborators include Karen Hunter, [Andrew
Edwards](http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/~english/), [Robyn
Forrest](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robyn_Forrest), and Greg Workman
(DFO PBS); [Eric Ward](https://eric-ward.github.io/) (NOAA Northwest Fisheries
Science Centre); and [Brendan
Connors](http://www.sfu.ca/~bconnors/Site/Home.html) (DFO Institute of Ocean
Sciences).

**Project overview:** This project will characterize the effects of a changing
climate in Canada's Pacific waters on the habitat ranges of groundfish species
identified as being of commercial and/or conservation importance. Range shifts
in response to climate change are non-uniform --- some species may expand their
range, some may shift northward or deeper to locate suitable conditions, and
others may have a range reduction or expansion. Therefore, it is critical to
know how species' distributions are changing, and which species are not keeping
pace with local climate velocities and may therefore be potentially losing
suitable habitat. Using spatiotemporal modelling of trawl survey data, the
project will: (1) identify latitudinal shifts, depth shifts, and changes to
range size for BC groundfish species through time; and (2) investigate whether
these trends track and are keeping pace with local velocities of temperature,
dissolved oxygen, and salinity. Results from this modeling will be used to
inform stock assessments and identify the species that may be the most
sensitive to climate change. While the focus of the position is on the above
research, the position will afford the opportunity for motivated individuals to
lead or contribute to other research on fish population ecology and management.

**Essential asset qualifications**: Applicants must have graduated from a PhD
in fisheries science, ecology, statistics, or a related discipline **within the
past three years** and have demonstrated expertise in statistical
modelling and the R programming language. Prior experience with spatiotemporal
modelling, Bayesian data analysis, and reproducible research would be an asset.
Successful candidates will be self-motivated and have a proven track record of
publishing their research in peer-reviewed journals. The position is available
for candidates of all nationalities but those who are not Canadian citizens or
permanent residents of Canada must satisfy Canadian immigration requirements.

**Location**: Pacific Biological Station, Nanaimo, British Columbia. The west
coast of Canada, and Vancouver Island in particular, is well known for its
rainforests, beaches, and mountains. It is a destination for kayaking, hiking,
surfing, skiing, diving, biking, and camping.

**Funding**: This fellowship is available to start
between now and mid-to-late fall 2018 and will be completed by March
2020 with the possibility of extension.
Funding includes a salary starting at ~$56,000
CAD/year (see [SE-RES-1 Step 1 and
2 payscale](http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/agreements-conventions/view-visualiser-eng.aspx?id=18#toc12670212673)),
medical and dental benefits, and travel and equipment support.
The [Canadian Government Postdoctoral
Research Program](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/careers/17880) is administered by Natural Resources Canada.
We are committed to employment equity and encourage
applications from women, visible minorities, aboriginal people, and
persons with disabilities.

**Contact**: Applicants should email a CV and a brief cover letter outlining
their interest in the project and their experience and skills to
sean.anderson@dfo-mpo.gc.ca. Short-listed applicants will be invited to
develop a full application through the Natural Resources Canada system.
Applications will be reviewed beginning August 7th, 2018.
